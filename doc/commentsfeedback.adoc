== Comments and Feedback

In the spirit of open source, we invite anyone to provide feedback and comments on any of the reference architectures. Although we review our papers internally, sometimes issues or typographical errors are encountered. Feedback allows us to not only improve the quality of the papers we produce, but allows the reader to provide their thoughts on potential improvements and topic expansion to the papers.
Feedback on the papers can be provided by emailing refarch-feedback@redhat.com. Please refer to the title within the email.

=== Staying In Touch

Join us on some of the popular social media sites where we keep our audience informed on new reference architectures as well as offer related information on things we find interesting.
